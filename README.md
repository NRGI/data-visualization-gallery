### Azerbaijan budget data
A mix of bar graphs and line graphs showing budget and oil revenue data over 10 years. The bars allow for easy comparison of changes in both the entire group and the subcategories individually. Interactivity includes values displayed on mouse hover, emphasis of specific series on mouse hover, and multiple sets of indicators to view. Visually appealing transitions capture attention.
